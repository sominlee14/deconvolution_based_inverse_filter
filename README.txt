This repository contains all the scripts, functions, and data necessary to run the analyses presented in "Digital reconstruction of infraslow activity in human ictal recordings using a deconvolution-based inverse filter". The exception is that patient recordings are not publicly available due to HIPAA protections, but they can be made available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author, Wim van Drongelen (wvandron@peds.bsd.uchicago.edu)
